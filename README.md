# Python Jobs Collector

## Motivation

This project is a practical application of my study of the Python course, in which I will collect some information related to Python jobs from the most famous employment sites "WUZZAF".

Also, It is also considered a practical application on **Web Scraping** principle which is an automatic way to retrieve unstructured data from a website and store them in a structured format.

## Used Modules

### Beautiful Soup

is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. It commonly saves programmers hours or days of work.

```python
$ pip install beautifulsoup4
```

###  lxml parser.

Beautiful Soup supports the HTML parser included in Pythonâ€™s standard library, but it also supports a number of third-party Python parsers. One is the lxml parser. Depending on your setup.

```python
$ pip install lxml
```

### requests

The requests module allows you to send HTTP requests using Python.

The HTTP request returns a Response Object with all the response data (content, encoding, status, etc).

```python
$ pip install requests
```
