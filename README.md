# Python Jobs Collector

## Motivation

This project is a practical application of my study of the Python course, in which I will collect some information related to Python jobs from the most famous employment sites "WUZZAF".

Also, It is also considered a practical application on **Web Scraping** principle which is an automatic way to retrieve unstructured data from a website and store them in a structured format.
